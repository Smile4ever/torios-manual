\textbf{Part 1 : set up virtual box - GNU / Linux}
To set install Virtual box on Ubuntu you should run the following \\

\begin{itemize}
\item{sudo apt-get install virtualbox-qt}
\item{sudo apt-get install virtualbox-dkms}
\end{itemize} 

After this you need to set up a virtual machine so that the MiniISO can be installed to this.   It is ASSUMED you know how to do this.  However you DO need to enable networking:\\ \\

You may also want to check to see if PAE has been enabled as toriOS is designed for NON PAE systems.\\

Once done you can run virtual box from the menu.

Compomemts such as USB amd sharing files with the host system are NOT supported unless using virtualbox extensions.  \\



\chapter{Obtaining the Ubuntu Mini ISO}

This step covers what is needed to convert a ubuntu 12.04 mini ISO to use the ToriOS desktop environment and related system components.\\ \\
\textbf{
Step 1:} Install ToriOS into the virtual machine created earlier. 

Download the iso file from the website below \\

http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise-updates/main/installer-i386/current/images/

netboot directory then nonPAE

file mini.iso

You will also need to download the md5sum checksum and verify the download. 

\chapter{Convert mini ISO to ToriOS}

Once you have downloaded and installed the Mini ISO you should be logged in as a default user,  and this user should be a member of the sudo-ers list so you can run sudo (as in run a command as root) as that user. \\
in which case you can wget the shell script and run that to convert to ToriOS\\

Download shell script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Israel-/torios-from-mini/master/torios-precise-x86.sh

set to execute permissions

chmod +x torios-precise-x86.sh


You can use wget -c for this
