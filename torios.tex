\chapter{Introduction}
\index{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to produce a minimalist Linux distribution that uses as little memory (RAM) as possible.



Ubuntu 12.04 is used as a base for this new system.
\subsection{About this Manual}

\chapter{What is GNU / Linux}

Linux refers to the kernel (the core) of the operating system.  GNU refers to the tools used with Linux and the licensing model these are released under,  GNU stands for GNUs Not Unix,  so these are versions of the tools you would find on the UNIX operating system but released under a free license in this case the GPL (General Public license).

\chapter{Installation - Getting ToriOS}
\index{Installation}
There are several steps to an installation. \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Decide on the installation media CD-R or flash disk
\item Prepare install media - in the case of a flash disk make sure this is empty
\item Prepare target media and decide where to install Torios to (for example a hard disk)
\item Download the iso file
\item Create your install media
\item Initial boot
\item Either install from menu or run live session and install from there


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Downloading the ISO}
\index{Downloading - CLI}
\subitem{Command Line}

See chapter \ref{Testing} for how to download and test the iso. 

\subitem{Browser}
\index{Downloading - Browser}

\text{You can also download using a web browser}

\subsection{Verifying the download}
There is an excellent guide at\\ \textbf{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM} \\
that explains how to check your downloaded iso file for errors.  Apart from the file name being different so for ToriOS you may have ToriOS-1.0.0.iso the steps are pretty much the same.  
Please see getting involved section as this covers some of the above during the testing phase,  that information will appear here once the test phase is over. 
\chapter{Creating install media}

\subsection{CD-R}
\index{CD-R/RW/DVD-R/RW}

When you have an ISO file or disk image you need to BURN image to cd.  When using which ever cd mastering program you have.  If you copy to CD you will have a cd with an ISO file on it.  You won't be able to boot from that media.

Examples of software for creating your CD / DVD include

\begin{itemize}
\item Windows vista and above can write / burn optical media
\item Brassero and k3b are examples of optical media software under Linux
\item There are several command line tools for this too.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Flash Disks - Unetbootin}
\index{Flash Disks}
\index{Unetbootin}
You can use unetbootin to create a bootable flash disk image,   

See the URL ref section for links to the unetbootin website \ref{URL REF}

http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/

You can follow the steps below \\

Creating a boot usb flash disk

(With thanks to Nio Wiklund for some helpful comments with regard to the title of this document)

A good tool for this is Unetbootin,  you can install this on most popular Linux distributions,

e.g sudo apt-get install unetbootin

you need your root password.

You can then load the software up, you will need your root password

Unetbootin as well as mkusb works in most linux distros, but I think
it is also very important, that Unetbootin works in Windows (and I
think also in MacOS). Please write very clearly, at or near page 16,
that Unetbootin can be installed in Windows and used to create a
ToriOS boot USB pendrive/stick/flash/thumb drive (whatever name you
prefer, or all of them).

http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/

\newpage




\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{unetbootin} 
\end{center}


If you have downloaded an iso image  you don?t need to worry about the top section

Click disk image,  ISO can be left as in,  then select the box with ? in and select the iso file

select type, usb drive or hard disk,  most people are going to want to create a usb boot flash disk.

drive should be the device reference for this disk

make sure you are 100 percent sure,  and if you are not sure ASK on forums , IRC or elsewhere first.

I find it helpful to unmount and unplug my external hdd first,  In other words if you don't want to write to it,  remove that device (if possible)

If you have already downloaded and md5 checked your iso file then you don?t need to worry about the top part,

Click disk image radio button

the drop down menu to the right of this is a between ISO and floppy

you can then click on file search button (the one with ? )
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{unetbootin2} 

\end{center}



Select if you want to have a persistent space for files.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{unetbootin3}
\end{center}

Type? you can choose between usb and hard disk \textbf{BE VERY CAREFUL} //

then select the device, if you select hard disk then the device reference chances to / indicating root of the file system. //

\textbf{REMEMBER} that you can wipe your whole file system if you get the options wrong,  if you have an external hard disk and a usb disk plugged in I find it helpful to unmount and unplug the external hard disk,  gives less target options and is less likely to get wiped by mistake. //

 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{unetbootin4}
\end{center}
You need to check if the target device should be mounted first or not

Hopefully this how to is useful, please be careful as I am not re-
sponsible for data loss, I try and write guides to be generic not
explicit guides. I will leave this to the documentation team
You can use fdisk and df to determine device references. Read the
man pages for more info if you get stuck as for help and say you
have looked at man pages, this blog post etc and are still stuck,
this shows you have tried to research the issue.

The ubuntu manual should have this information in it too.

man unetbootin

man fdisk

man ls

man df

If you need to format the flash disk, using disks, this is a case of

Unmount the flash disk

Select format

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DEVICE SELECTED.

Once this is all done and you are happy with the destination click OK

Progress bar showing how many files have been copied and a percentage


\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{unetbootin5} \\

All done you can now reboot, select usb disk from the boot device menu (see your Manual on how to access this) and tryout /  install the new OS

\text{unetbootin also works from Windows / Mac}

\subsection{Flash Disks - mkUsb}
\index{MkUSB}
\text{mkUSB - Make USB}

See the URL ref section for links to the information on mkusb \ref{URL REF}

mkusb is split now into one GUI program 'mkusb' and two console or text
applications, mkusb-nox and mkusb-bas. The GUI version works in ToriOS
(as well as in Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, openSUSE. Arch to mention a few
distros).

mkusb-nox 'can do what mkusb can' but without eye-candy. mkusb-bas is
basic and can be used in simple distros, where certain tools are not
available (I have tested and tweaked it to work in Wary Puppy and Tiny
Core).

\chapter{BOOTING INSTALL MEDIA}

\text{Depending on how your computer is set up,  you need to tell the computer to boot of which ever boot media you created either a) cdrom b) dvd c) usb.} //

\subsection{UEFI Boot}
If you have very new hardware then you may have the new UEFI boot system,  this means you can't just boot the install media and there are a few extra steps.  These are outlined here.

ToriOS will use the JWM (Joe's Window Manager) window environment:\\

The following is quoted from the projects website

\begin{quote}
JWM is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window System. JWM is written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum. Because of its small footprint, JWM makes a good window manager for older computers and less powerful systems, such as the Raspberry Pi, though it is perfectly capable of running on modern systems. JWM is included in small Linux distributions such as Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux, and it is available as a separate package in many other distributions.

\textbf{Known issues (2014-Aug-29):}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Menu does not display items that do not use a desktop file}  
\item{Missing features in the Settings Manager}
\item{USB mounting support ONLY (no CD/DVD mounting unless using a terminal)}
\item{Hardly any apps installed (this is a feature) :D}
\item{Menu categories do not support localization yet, though all desktop files that have it are supported in the menu}
\end{itemize}

This uses the OBI installer. \\ \\
It should run quite easily on 128MB ram for the Live version, and in even less for the installer.  It currently uses around 60-70MB Ram to run. \\ \\
Currently you can try out the Live version, and install ONLY from the text installer (or you can use the terminal and launch OBI).
It is highly suggested that you use the Live version ONLY \\ \\

\begin{center}

\textbf{THIS WILL OVERWRITE THE ENTIRE DEVICE IF YOU 
INSTALL IT} \\

\end{center}

You should backup all your  personal files, and your OS if you choose to install this.\\ \\
ToriOS contains a tool called mktbl, this tool can backup your entire disk as a tarball to easily reinstall \\ \\

\subsection {Testing virtual box images}
\index{Testing virtual box images}
\index{Virtualbox}
See \ref{URL REF} for website on virtual box.

Once you are signed up then you can start testing the latest build this can be downloaded as a Virtual box image with.

wget -c http://torios.org/VB/ToriBuilder.vdi.xz \\

Once done you need to extract,   either right click and select extract here or use the command line.  Due to the size of the Virtual box image this may take some time. \\

Once this is done you will have a new file called:    in the ToriBuilder.vdi folder,  


Open virtual box

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{extractVBimage}
\end{center}

Virtual box 
Click New

\begin{center}
\item \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ToriosTest01}
\end{center}

Use the following options
\begin{itemize}
\item Name : Torios
\item Type : Linux
\item Version : Ubuntu 32 bit
\end{itemize}

Click Next

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ToriosTest02}
\end{center}

Should be Ok to leave the default memory as 256MB,so click next.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ToriosTest03}
\end{center}

Upon opening virtual box you will see this screen:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{virtualbox}
\end{center}

Click use existing and select the file you downloaded earlier, so in this case its \textbf{ToriBuilder.vdi}

Click done.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ToriosTest-done}
\end{center}

Torios needs PAE support enabled to do this select the virtual box image you just created,  and click settings.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{ToriosEnablePAE}
\end{center}

Click system, then processor tab then check the box EnablePAE/NX then press OK.

You should then bereturned to the main virtual box window,  the image should still be selected so press start and you should boot in to the Torios Test Image. 

 note yours may look different as I have a few images,  also note in this screen shot i have a different vm set up.  We still need to open up the ToriOS image we downloaded. 

We will assume here you have thus already installed.
