\chapter{Installation}
\subsection{Downloading the ISO}
\subsection{Verifying the download}
There is an excellent guide at\\ \textbf{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM} \\
that explains how to check your downloaded iso file for errors.  Apart from the file name being different so for ToriOS you may have ToriOS-1.0.0.iso the steps are pretty much the same.  
\subsection{Creating install media}
\subsection{booting install media}
Depending on how your computer is set up,  you need to tell the computer to boot of which ever boot media you created either a) cdrom b) dvd c) usb.

\subsection{UEFI Boot}
If you have very new hardware then you may have the new UEFI boot system,  this means you can't just boot the install media and there are a few extra steps.  These are outlined here.
