  Introduction
  The goal of this project is to produce a minimalist Linux distribution that
  gives end users more choice as to what software is installed on their system.
     Ubuntu 12.04 is used as a base for this new system.

  What is GNU / Linux
  2.0.2   About ToriOS
  ToriOS is a system aimed at replacing Windows XP, which will reach end-
  of-life in April 2014. ToriOS is a fast and minimal system based on Ubuntu
  12.04.
  2.0.3   Non PAE Support
  ToriOS will support PAE Hardware
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/torios/+spec/non-pae-support
  2.0.4   Technical overview
     1. 1- ToriOS is supporting Non-PAE machines by default - we have already
        agreed on that - just a reminder.
     2. 2- ToriOS is always an LTS - we too agreed on that as well - just a
        reminder.
     3. 3- ToriOS will be released every 12 months NOT every 6 months like
        Ubuntu - new idea.
     4. 4- ToriOS 1.0 is based on 12.04 LTS - we have discussed that before
        but didn&#8217;t yet 100
     5. 5- ToriOS 2.0 will be based on 14.04 LTS
     6. 6- nm-manager should not be used as far as I have read so far from dif-
        ferent people all of them confirmed the big RAM eater is nm-manager.

          8                                           CHAPTER 2.  WHAT IS GNU / LINUX
             7. 7- While we&#8217;re targeting low hardware machines (32-bit), shouldn&#8217;t we
                also think of those who wish to try ToriOS on more powerful machine
                (64bit)? if that so, we need two builds: i386 and amd64.
             8. 8- I need the Wiki and Docs team to write each and every post, not
                only about the system, how to use it, system requirement, etc ... no ...
                I&#8217;m planning to document the steps that we have done to create this or
                will create this system and YES, I mean the technical side so I guess
                both the docs and devs guys need to work side by side if you agree on
                this.
             9. 9- 60MB or 50MB? don&#8217;t want to kill ourselves but if we could do that,
                why not? I guess you know what I&#8217;m talking about
            10. 10- Have we thought about the ISO size?  any idea how big will it
                be? around 300Told or asked there is a difference, problem is some old
                people are very rude due to lack of proper discipline when they were
                younger and think they can barge past people , and treat people with
                little respect, if you ask nicely people usually oblige if you tellpeople
                rudeluyMB? 400MB? less or more? AFAIK, it should never reach say
                600MB, right?
            11. 11- Where are we going to host the ISOs? do we have a host for that?
            12. 12- As long as ToriOS is based on Ubuntu, we can test it on Virtual
                Machine such as OracleVB, correct?
            13. 13- By any chance, do we need to talk with Ubuntu/Canonical team
                about our Project?  I mean is there any kind of approval or stuff like
                that we need? I&#8217;m talking about the technical side of our project as they
                should have nothing to do with thewget -c http://torios.org/VB/ToriBuilder.vdi.xz
                other stuff but maybe they do with the technical side, that is why I&#8217;m
                asking and we need to know IMHO.
            14. 14- Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1, Beta 2 and RC? or no need for that?
                should we just do Alpha, Beta and RC? these are milestones just like
                what Ubuntu GNOME or Lubuntu are doing when it comes to the
                development cycle.
            15. 15- I know it is hard to tell at this point but any idea when ToriOS 1.0
                will be available to download and use? I know I&#8217;m the one who should
                announce that but if truth to be told, it is something that our devs
                should advise for and we haven&#8217;t yet done anything serious.

  Installation
  There are several steps to an installation.
     1. decide on the installation media CD-R or Flash disk
     2. Prepare install media - in the case of a flash disk make sure this is
        blank
     3. Prepare target media and decide where to install Torios to
     4. Download the iso file
     5. Create your install media
     6. initial boot
     7. either install from menu or run live session and install from there
  4.0.5   Downloading the ISO
      Command Line To download from the command line you can use the
          wget command, if you use the -c argument. Then if the download is
          stopped or interupted then it will carry from where it left off if you
          re-run the command.
          Browser

          4.0.6   Verifying the download
          There is an excellent guide at
          https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
          that explains how to check your downloaded iso file for errors.  Apart from
          the file name being different so for ToriOS you may have ToriOS-1.0.0.iso
          the steps are pretty much the same.
          4.0.7   Creating install media
          4.0.8   CD-R
          4.0.9   Flash Disks
          You can use unetbootln to bootable flash disk image, http://zleap.net/?s=unetboot
             You can follow the steps below
             Creating a boot usb flash disk
             (With thanks to Nio Wiklund for some helpful comments with regard to
          the title of this document)
             A good tool for this is Unetbootin, you can install this on most popular
          Linux distributions,
             e.g sudo apt-get install unetbootin
             you need your root password.
             You can then load the software up, you will need your root password
                                               
             If you have downloaded an iso image you don?t need to worry about the
          top section
             Click disk image, ISO can be left as in, then click the box with ? in and
          select the iso file
             select type, usb drive or hard disk, most people are going to want to
          create a usb boot flash disk.
             drive should be the device reference for this disk
             make sure you are 100 percent sure, and if you are not sure ASK on
          forums , IRC or elsewhere first.
             I find it helpful to unmount and unplug my external hdd first, it gives
          less options but also reduces the chances I will write to it, The disks tool
          below is useful for finding out what device you are writing to.
             If you have already downloaded and md5 checked your iso file then you
          don?t need to worry about the top part,

                                                                          13
     Click disk image radio button
     the drop down menu to the right of this is a betweet ISO and floppy
     you can then click on file search button (the one with ? )
                                       
     Select if you want to have a persistent space for files.
                                       
     type ? you can choose between usb and hard disk (BE VERY CAREFUL)
     then select the device, if you select hard disk then the device reference
  chances to / indicating root of the file system.
  REMEMBER that you can wipe your whole file system if you get
  the options wrong, if you have an external hard disk and a usb disk
  plugged in I find it helpful to unmount and unplug the external
  hard disk, gives less target options and is less likely to get wiped
  by mistake.   
                                       
  You need to check if the target device should be mounted first or not
  Hopefully this how to is useful, please be careful as I am not re-
  sponsible for data loss, I try and write guides to be generic not
  explicit guides. I will leave this to the documentation team   
  You can use fdisk and df to determine device references. Read the
  man pages for more info if you get stuck as for help and say you
  have looked at man pages, this blog post etc and are still stuck,
  this shows you have tried to research the issue.   The ubuntu manual
  should have this information in it too.
     man unetbootin
     man fdisk
     man ls
     man df
     If you need to format the flash disk, using disks, this is a case of
     Unmount the flash disk
     Select format
     MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DEVICE SELECTED.
     Once this is all done and you are happy with the destination click OK

          14                                                     CHAPTER 4.  INSTALLATION
             Progress bar showing how many files have been copied and a percentage
             All done you can now reboot, select usb disk from the boot device menu
          (see your Manual on how to access this) and tryout / install the new OS
          4.0.10   booting install media
          Depending on how your computer is set up, you need to tell the computer to
          boot of which ever boot media you created either a) cdrom b) dvd c) usb.
          4.0.11   UEFI Boot
          If you have very new hardware then you may have the new UEFI boot system,
          this means you can&#8217;t just boot the install media and there are a few extra
          steps. These are outlined here.
          4.0.12   Installing
          Within Torios there is an installer called OBI - One button installer, this will
          take you through the steps needed to install the Operating system.
             Installation is covered in several documents which can be found in /Desk-
          top/Documents mainly OBI-quickstart-manual.pdf
          4.0.13   Final steps

  Desktop
  5.0.15   JWM Settings
  ToriOS will use the JWM (Joe&#8217;s Window Manager) window environment:
     The following is quoted from the projects website
        JWM is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window
        System. JWM is written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum.
        Because of its small footprint, JWM makes a good window man-
        ager for older computers and less powerful systems, such as the
        Raspberry Pi, though it is perfectly capable of running on mod-
        ern systems. JWM is included in small Linux distributions such
        as Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux, and it is available as a
        separate package in many other distributions.

  7.0.16   testing
  Once you are signed up then you can start testing the latest build this can
  be downloaded as a Virtual box image with.
     wget -c http://torios.org/VB/ToriBuilder.vdi.xz
     Once done you need to extract, either right click and select extract here
  or use the command line. Due to the size of the Virtual box image this may
  take some time.

             Once this is done you will have a new file called:  in the ToriBuilder.vdi
          folder,
             Open virtual box
                                               
             Virtual box Click New
                                               
                                               
             Use the following options
             &#x2219; Name : Torios
             &#x2219; Type : Linux
             &#x2219; Version : Ubuntu 32 bit
             Click Next
                                               
             Should be Ok to leave the default memory as 256MB,so click next.
                                               
             Upon opening virtual box you will see this screen:
                                               
             Click use existing and select the file you downloaded earlier, so in this
          case its ToriBuilder.vdi
             Click done.
                                               
             Torios needs PAE support enabled to do this select the virtual box image
          you just created, and click settings.
                                               
             Click system, then processor tab then check the box EnablePAE/NX then
          press OK.
             You should then bereturned to the main virtual box window, the image
          should still be selected so press start and you should boot in to the Torios
          Test Image.
             note yours may look different as I have a few images, also note in this
          screen shot i have a different vm set up. We still need to open up the ToriOS
          image we downloaded.
             We will assume here you have thus already installed.
